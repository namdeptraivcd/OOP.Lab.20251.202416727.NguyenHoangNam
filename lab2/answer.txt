Question: 
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this? 

--> Yes, Java allows it. For example, we have Constructor DVD (String title) and Constructor DVD (float cost). When we create new object DVD, we can pass parameter type String (DVD by title) or parameter type float (DVD by cost). This is overloading method.
