-> Clearly, NoGarbage is much faster than GarbageCreator. Because in NoGarbage, we use StringBuilder, it is mutable
so when we append new char, it just appends a new character into local buffer without create new obj -> No trash to clean.
Otherwise, in GarbageCreator, String is immutable, so when we += new char, it has to create new (String+add new char). 
Therefore, if we have many character to add, it will create many garbage in the end, and to clean, it is time-wasteful
